# Data-Science
This folder consists of all of the work I have done recently in data. The tools that I have used are Python, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Docker, Terraform, Apache Airflow and Spark. I have done projects using:
- Python for data analytics (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Python webscraping (selenium, beautifulsoup)
- Machine learning (scikit-learn)
- SQL for analytics
- Data warehouse creation (OLAP star schema on SQL)
- BI reporting (Tableau, PowerBI)
- Postgres, MSSQL databases using Docker containers and their respective GUI i.e. PgAdmin and MSSMS
- Scheduled Pipelines using Airflow
- Data transformation using Spark
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
