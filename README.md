# Data-Science
This folder consists of all of the work I have done recently in data. The tools that I have used are Python, SQL, Tableau and PowerBI. I have done projects using:
- Python for data analytics (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Python webscraping (selenium, beautifulsoup)
- Machine learning (scikit-learn)
- SQL for analytics
- Data warehouse creation (OLAP star schema on SQL)
- BI reporting (Tableau, PowerBI)
