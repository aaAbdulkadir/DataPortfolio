## Overview

This project consists of creating an ETL pipeline whereby I collect COVID data from the World Data website, use that data to find useful analytical insights that could be displayed on PowerBI for BI reporting. The dashboard is intended to update everyday with new data by automating the processing and connecting each stage such that the data reflected on the dashboard is relevant. This script will achieve that goal and will be ran daily using windows task scheduler for simplicity.


Note: Cannot upload PBIX file as it is too large.
