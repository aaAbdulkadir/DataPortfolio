## Overview

Galleria Holdings is a fast-food chain which originated in Italy but has now acquired a number of businesses in the UK. The company believes that the UK menus are too large and inconsistent across the outlets they have acquired. They also believe that the menus should be consolidated to suit the preferences of the customers and therefore reduce unnecessary purchases of food which is not chosen by customers. 

In order to achieve this, the parent company wishes to create a data warehouse for Business Intelligence purposes.

They wish to analyse sales to determine the most popular menu items and also those which produce the most revenue. They also wish to find out the most popular product groups and those which provide the most revenue. Finally, they wish to construct a “league table” of the total weekly and monthly sales of the various outlets so that their sales performance can be monitored easily.

## Project Brief

The project brief is as follows:

-	Review the case study and identify the business requirements from a reporting perspective. Your overall objective is to design a data warehouse capable of reporting on the questions the business wish to answer.
   
- Perform an assessment of the initial dataset to:
  - Understand the data items and how they relate together.
  - Identify any data quality issues which could affect your implementation.

-	Design the schema to satisfy the requirements.

- Implement the ETL to create and populate the tables in PowerBI ensuring all counts reconcile.

-	Create a set of visualisations to meet the reporting requirements contained in the brief.

## Tools Used

I used python to understand, clean and peform EDA of the data, I created an OLAP star schema on SQL and finished it up with a dashboard on PowerBI.
